Daily gas supply-consumption dataset for EU27&UK derived from pipeline flow data and network simulation

[paper](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/949/2023/essd-15-949-2023.html)

[dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/7562201)

***Updated from 2016-01-01 to 2024-03-01***



Notes:

1. The uncertainty associated with the network simulation for the year 2016 is larger as there is no eariler data.
2. The division of the consumption sector is mainlyreliant on the Eurostat [dataset](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-datasets/-/nrg_cb_gas), which may introduce delays in reflecting recent data.
3. For the United Kingdom, data on the division of the consumption sector post-2021 is unavailable from Eurostat, resulting in the ratios for different sectors being maintained as they were in 2021.


**I will update another dataset for intra-EU gas transmission soon.**
